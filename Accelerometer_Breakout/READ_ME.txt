The H3LIS331DL is a low-power high performance 3-axis linear accelerometer capable of withstanding high G-loads of up to Â± 400Gs making it ideal for rockets.

The accelerometer supports both SPI and I2C, and the breakout board has pin-headers for them, respectively.

SPI Read:

Bit 0: READ bit. Value = 1
Bit 1: MS bit. 	Value = 0 means no increment in address
		Value = 1 means increments in the address (For multiple reads)
Bit 2-7: Address AD(5:0). Address field of the Register
Bit 8-15: Data DO(7:0)(Read Mode). Reads data (MSB First)
Bit 16-...: Data DO(...-8). Further data in multiple byte reads

SPI Write:

Bit 0: WRITE bit. Value = 0
Bit 1: MS bit. 	Value = 0 means no increment in address
		Value = 1 means increments in the address (For multiple reads)
Bit 2-7: Address AD(5:0). Address field of the Register
Bit 8-15: Data DO(7:0)(Write Mode). Writes data (MSB First)
Bit 16-...: Data DO(...-8). Further data in multiple byte writes

SPI Read 3-wire mode
Bit 0: READ bit. Value = 1
Bit 1: MS bit. 	Value = 0 means no increment in address
		Value = 1 means increments in the address (For multiple reads)
Bit 2-7: Address AD(5:0). Address field of the Register
Bit 8-15: Data DO(7:0)(Read Mode). Reads data (MSB First)
