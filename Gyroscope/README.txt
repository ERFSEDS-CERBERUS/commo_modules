The Gyroscope is more accurately described as an IMU, it allows for reading both
rotational information as a Gyroscope however it also allows for reading 
accelleration values less that 24g which makes it not ideal for the requirements 
so a dedicated accelerometer is also used. 

The IMU also has a temperature sensor that can be used to monitor the temperature
inside the rocket.

THe Gyroscope supports both I2C and SPI, however due to the prefference of SPI,
that is the only protocol that will be covered here, for information in I2C refer
to the datasheet

It also appears that there are interupts that can be used to trigger events, say 
engine ignition for a rocket.

TO read data from this sensor format data as follows
uint16_t SPI_DATA = (0x7F & reg_addr) << 8
spi_send(addr, SPI_DATA)
	NOTE: some registers return 1 byte and some return 2!
	Data is read during the 2nd byte
To write Data to this sensor use the following
uint16_t SPI_DATA = ((0x80 | reg_addr) << 8 ) | DATA_BYTE
spi_send(addr, SPI_DATA)


Important registers

Register Name: Register Value
Register Purpose
